The magpie brought two matchmakers and you threw them the challenge: not less than five full quan, five thousand areca nuts, five fat pigs, and five suits of clothes. <br> Mother, I am twenty-three this year and still without a husband. What, Mother, dear, is your plan?

What, Mother, darling, is your plan? The magpie brought two matchmakers and you threw them the challenge: not less than one full quan, one thousand areca nuts, one fat dog this time, and one suit of clothes. <br> Mother, I am forty-three this year. Still without a husband. Mother, look, Mother, will you please just give me away?

                    <p>If sometimes I fall asleep in a lecture
                        Or shout and scream as if alone
                        Please forgive me, please don’t be angry
                        For I have no place to play. <br> I’m growing up I want to be a sailor
                        I’m wishing for a giant arena, a stream
                        I feel like yelling my life is beginning
                        Every minute I want to hold tight to my dreams. <br> But the fires of war have shriveled my joys 
                        At every step I see guns turned on me
                        At every word I hear the crash of steel 
                        Not believing, not understanding I only stare.
                        The slaughter goes on and on,
                        Blood and bones and hatred all strained red. <br> People running from the front to look out for themselves
                        Cheating, lying, stabbing others in the back
                        Some of my friends have fallen.
                        No one knew, no one cared, they were dewdrops that’s all.
                        My home will be burnt to the ground
                        The way back cut off, partitioned…

                     <p>We live inside odd-shaped submarines chasing after secrets and the darkness of the ocean on a voyage toward plastic horizons where vague connections can never be reached and hopes are not deployed before the storm arrives and the alarm command starts to rouse the last illusions to stand up and put life jackets on looking to each other for help <br> Once I was at the equator trying to slice the earth in half along the dotted line but someone held my hand and said: “If you do that, friend, water will fall into the void, and then our submarine won’t have any place to dive.”</p>
